=== An implementation of checkers, done in basic C++11
The  rules used are the standard rules outlined in this Wikipedia

I have implemented a simple load/save mechanism, which uses basic ASCII
	text files. If you try to load an improper file, you will likely
	end up with an empty or very strange board.
	
To compile this project, change into the project directory, then type "cmake ."
	The project is configured to compile with clang, but can easily be changed
	to use gcc in the CMakeLists.txt file.

Then type "make app_test". This will generate the app_test binary to run. The project
	depends on the SFML and GTK libraries to compile.
	 
This project requires C++11 support to compile.

Type "./app_test" to run it, and the window will appear. The app has checkpointing,
	save/load, and exit buttons. You play as black pieces. To move,
	simply click on the piece you want to move, then on a legal empty space or on
	a piece you want to move.

Diagnostics will print in the terminal if you launch the binary from one.
